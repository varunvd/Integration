# Integration

This program is going to perform definite integraion it requires the user to specify the upper limit, the lower limit and expression.
It is written in python and requires the user to provide the input in a corresponding manner.

Example : -
        Lower Limit = 0
        Upper Limit = 1
        Expression = x
        Answer = 0.5
        
        Lower Limit = 0
        Upper Limit=1
        Expression = x^2+5
        Answer = 5.33
        
Another program convert^topow.py is used to convert the expression having ^ to pow(). It requires the trignometeric and logrithmic functions to be placed within parenthesis.
  
Example : -
        Expression x^7
        Output pow(x,7)
        
        Expression (sin(x))^34+98+(x-5)^33+89^66
        Output pow((sin(x)),34)+98+pow((x-5),33)+pow(89,66)
